# Other Recommended Reclining Sofas - Quick Reference

## 1. Steve Silver Katrine
**Model #:** KT800SC  
**Where to Find:** Luna Furniture, Raymour & Flanigan, or local furniture retailers via Steve Silver Company retailers  
**Price:** ~$799 (often on sale for as low as $559)  
**Rating:** 4.7/5 stars  
*Description: The Katrine sofa is a slightly smaller option at 83.5 inches wide, featuring charcoal gray faux leather with contrast baseball stitching and raised, padded headrests. It stands out with its fiber-encased foam cushions with inner coil springs for superior support without sagging, with customers noting the "stitching is beautiful...the cushions are firm yet comfortable." Despite its trim width, it provides excellent value at typically under $800, with a sturdy all-metal recline mechanism and durability that holds up well against pets.*

## 2. Catnapper Gill
**Model #:** 2641  
**Where to Find:** Haynes Furniture, The Dump Furniture Outlet, or local retailers via Catnapper's "Find a Retailer" tool  
**Price:** ~$799-899 (outlet price)  
**Rating:** 4.5/5 stars  
*Description: The Gill sofa features premium gel-infused memory foam cushioning and a supportive "waterfall back" design that follows the curve of your spine when fully reclined. Upholstered in slate gray breathable faux leather with a subtle texture and slight sheen, it offers a contemporary look with straight, padded track arms. At around 80 inches wide, it's built with a heavy-duty steel seat box and Comfort Coil system that distributes weight evenly, with retailers describing it as delivering "unmatched comfort and style" with cooling properties that prevent overheating during extended use.*

## 3. Similar Value Options at Major Retailers

**Price Range:** $699-1,069  
**Rating:** 4.0-4.8/5 stars

These alternatives often feature comparable specifications to our recommended models but may be more readily available for in-person testing at local showrooms.*
