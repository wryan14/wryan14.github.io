     "The Spiritual Transformation of the Heart: John Wesley's Sermon, Circumcision of the Heart
    </h2>
    <p>
     John Wesley emphasizes in his sermon, Circumcision of the Heart, the importance of a spiritual transformation and the role of faith and grace in the process. He argues for an internal transformation that goes beyond religious systems of external behavior alone, one that allows God's presence to enter into an individual's heart. He suggests that the spiritual practice of circumcision from Judaism can be adapted to Christian piety and that this inner transformation is necessary for true and sincere faith.
