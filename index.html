    </h2>
    <p>
     John Wesley's 1741 sermon, The Almost Christian, is a timeless reflection on the power of true Christian conversion, emphasizing the importance of internal transformation through commitment to the gospel. He argues that being a Christian requires more than just belief, and that one must actively engage with the scriptures by "letting it penetrate your soul." Through careful and serious study, Evans explains that one is enabled to reach a sincere state of virtue and rid themselves of worldly affections. Despite the passage of time, this powerful message of spiritual awakening remains just as relevant today.

     The Power of Spiritual Circumcision: A Guide to Transformation and Sanctification Through Old Testament Spirituality
    </h2>
    <p>
     John Wesley's sermon outlines how spiritual transformation of believers is attained in the New Testament. The physical circumcision of the Old Testament is replaced by a spiritual metamorphosis, marked by a realization and repentance of sin and submission to God's law. Wesley asserts that this transformation should be demonstrated through action and affection, involving prayer, obedience to God's word, and honoring the covenant with Him. He engages heavily with religious scriptures, specifically Deuteronomy, to offer a meaningful understanding of how Old Testament spirituality is relevant to believers today.
