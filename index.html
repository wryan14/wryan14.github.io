<h2>Lessons From John Wesley's Sermon on Circumcision of the Heart</h2><p>In his famous sermon, Circumcision of the Heart, Anglican theologian and preacher John Wesley introduced the concept of heart-circumcision — a way of understanding faith as something at the core of a person, rather than an outward show of religious observance. Written in 1785, Wesley argued for the power of Christian faith to transform the heart, and thus bring about a lasting and meaningful change in a person. Wesley's concept is still relevant today, as social activists strive to bring about meaningful change in our collective hearts and minds through systemic progress and cultural reform. Just as Wesley exhorted his listeners to look inward in pursuit of peace and unity, we must nonetheless continue to push societal boundaries, challenge accepted standards, and create opportunities for meaningful reform. In our modern world, we must seek spiritual and social transformation beyond just the realm of our own hearts — an idea that Wesley certainly championed.</p>
