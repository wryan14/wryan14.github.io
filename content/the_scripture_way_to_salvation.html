                    <p><br><br>John Wesley’s sermon, The Scripture Way To Salvation, is firmly rooted in scripture to find the way to salvation. He begins his sermon by acutely assessing the state of salvation of humanity, urging the people to seek after salvation as they would any “natural” good, such as food or water. He then quotes numerous references from scripture illustrating God’s desire for people to seek out salvation, emphasizing that this is God’s desire and it is up to mankind to ultimately decide whether to accept or reject it. Wesley then explains how it is possible for humanity to achieve salvation through his understanding of the four steps outlined in scripture: faith, repentance, justification, and sanctification. He believes that each of these steps is necessary for one to attain the full experience of the grace of God, thus making the path to salvation clear.<br><br>To emphasize the importance of personal commitment to the way to salvation, Wesley implores his listeners to seek not just the outwardly show of faith, but to go beyond it and make the inward commitment to live authentically and genuinely. He tells his listeners to grow in their faith and bears witness to the power of God’s grace, thereby enabling them to live in acceptance of His grace. He then moves to discuss the importance of humility in order to come close to God, for “in every moment of prayer and humiliation” one can receive God’s grace and take a step closer to salvation.<br><br>Wesley goes on to critique the works of James and Heb 5:11-12 which he believes to be confusing in terms of who exactly is eligible for salvation. He recommends reading those passages in a more literal form and avoiding speculating on outward show of faith, for that would lead away from salvation. He also makes a point on how entire communities are close to salvation, which gives them a greater chance of getting to heaven. He believes each person’s salvation to be a collective effort, as “none can be saved unless many pray and labor”, and calls on his congregation to be united in their mission.<br><br>John Wesley’s sermon, The Scripture Way to Salvation, provides a clear and concise explanation of the path to salvation outlined in scripture. By clearly delineating the four steps to salvation, namely faith, repentance, justification, and sanctification, Wesley plainly outlines the path to salvation. Furthermore, he reinforces the importance of participating wholeheartedly in this path with teachings of humility, as well as taking collective action to reach salvation as a community. Wesley’s sermon also critiques false interpretations of scripture, recommending a literal form in which to read the passages that is closer to the intended meaning. In sum, through The Scripture Way To Salvation, Wesley’s message is distinct and emphasises a clear path to the salvation offered by the grace of God.</p>
