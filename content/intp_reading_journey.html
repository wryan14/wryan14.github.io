    <h1>INTP Deep Reading Journey: From Theory to Praxis</h1>
    
    <div class="insight">
        "The unexamined life is not worth living, but the unlived life is not worth examining." - Adapted from Socrates
    </div>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This reading journey is designed for the INTP mind - systematic, deep-diving, and seeking coherent frameworks that can be applied to life. Each track interweaves theoretical depth with practical application, recognizing that true understanding comes through both contemplation and implementation.</p>

    <div class="why">
        <h3>Why This Structure?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Built for Ti-Ne cognitive functions: systematic analysis followed by pattern recognition</li>

            <li>Creates dialogues across disciplines and epochs</li>
            <li>Challenges both analytical and intuitive thinking</li>
            <li>Develops both vertical (deep) and horizontal (broad) understanding</li>
