                    <p><br><br>John Wesley's sermon, "On Guardian Angels," was written to encourage individuals to learn more about their spiritual guardians, or guardian angels. In his sermon, Wesley acknowledges that there is disagreement among the varying denominations of Christianity on the topic of Guardian Angels, yet he offers a glimpse into his own firmly held belief that the angels of God are real. Wesley goes on to say that although these spiritual creatures are invisible to us, they exist to protect us and continually attend to us.<br><br>Wesley further explains that each of us are appointed our own angel and warns against engaging in conversations or dialogues with these angels. Such conversations, he says, not only encourage idle curiosity but can be dangerous, as we cannot be certain if the spirit is from God or from the devil in human form. According to Wesley, the importance of Guardian Angels is not to be disregarded; their purpose is to guard us and promote good habits, so that our lives will be conduced in a way that pleases God. Indeed, Wesley posits that Guardian Angels often reveal the will of God in a vision or dream so that a person might better know their place in life.<br><br>Ultimately, Wesley suggests that adherence to the teachings of Scripture and Christian tradition are the surest and safest way to benefit from the presence of Guardian Angels. He cautions against those who seek direct or tangible proof of the angels themselves and encourages his readers to stay vigilant in their Christian faith, and accept this concept of Godâ€™s creatures with faith, understanding and humility. Wesley's final words in the sermon are meant to remind us of the spiritual protection and guidance we receive from our Guardian Angels and to reinforce our faith in the mysterious, yet divine providence of God.<br><br>In conclusion, John Wesley's sermon, "On Guardian Angels," is a powerful reminder of our spiritual guardians, whose purpose is to watch over and protect us, those whom God has appointed. Wesley's sermon reflects the power of faith in one's religious beliefs, reminding us that an act of trust and humility to accept that which we cannot see is necessary to benefit from the presence of Guardian Angels. His words serve as an inspiration to us all to stay ever vigilant in our devotion and commitment to our faith and to always heed the divine wisdom of our Heavenly Father.</p>
