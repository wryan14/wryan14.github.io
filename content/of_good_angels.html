                    <p><br><br>John Wesley's sermon Of Good Angels offers a critical examination of the role of angels in various aspects of life and Christian doctrine. After introducing the topic, Wesley outlines the scriptural references for angels' existence and the purposes for which they are used, chiefly the execution of God's commands. He then breaks down the various kinds of angels, making special reference to cherubim, seraphim, and Guardian Angels. With great detail, Wesley explains the disposition and attributes of these angels—notes that they are powerful but not omniscient, free but not self-determined, and that they have limited access to seeing the full scope of the divine plan. In addition, he speaks of the possibility of evil angels—or demons—who abide by their own will and are actively working against us.<br><br>Wesley then dives into a discussion of the benefits that accompany the presence of the good angels. He postulates that those who have accepted Jesus are beneficiaries of the angels, who serve as teachers and comforters. Furthermore, he highlights that the presence of good angels serves to devastate our enemies, quell our fears, and overcome our doubts. Finally, Wesley encourages us to call on these angels for protection against all the possible dangers we can face.<br><br>In summation, John Wesley's sermon, Of Good Angels, provides a comprehensive overview and analysis of the part angels play in religious doctrine and our lives. Wesley begins by noting the scriptural references for angels' existence and outlining their primary purpose. He then breaks down the diverse range of angels from cherubim to Guardian Angels, taking pains to explain their characteristics, attributes, and limitations. Additionally, he underscores the positive effects that good angels can have in our lives, such as comforting us, instilling courage, and providing us with a layer of protection against enemies. Ultimately, Wesley's sermon provides great insight into the impact angels can have on our lives and the importance of soliciting their aid in times of trouble.</p>
