John Wesley's "On Schism" sermon highlights the damaging effects of division within the church. He emphasizes the importance of unity between the members, arguing that separation should only occur in extreme cases where one is compelled by conscience to do so. Wesley further emphasizes that members must not split on matters of opinion, as opinions are never certain, but rather on matters of principle, where one's conscience is left as the sole judge. He emphasizes that even then, members of the church must understand that division is only for a season and that both sides should seek to reestablish unity should it be possible.</p>
