                    <p><br><br>In his sermon, On Schism, John Wesley warned his congregation against causing or participating in schismatic behavior. According to Wesley, schism is a sin that harms both the individual and the entire body of Christ. He argued that it is never acceptable to separate from other Christians in the pursuit of one’s own desires, and that schismatic behavior damages the unity of the church.<br><br>Wesley begins by asserting that schism is a sin, plain and simple, and that its effects are felt by the individual and the church at large. He observes that, as members of the church, we are all part of an inseparable “whole”, and suggests that we should not allow schismatic behavior to weaken the “bonds of love” that the church shares. He asserts that the wholeness of the Church is disrupted by a spirit of disunion, or contention, and suggests that this could be remedied by “heartily agreeing in the same thing”.<br><br>Wesley describes schism as a moral decay that will result in spiritual death. He explains that schism can manifest in a variety of ways, from refusing to pray for “opposite” congregations, to withholding support from fellow members. He encourages individuals to “go beyond mere external association” and instead engage in mutual edification and support.<br><br>He warns against the consequences of schismatic behavior and cautions against allowing personal interests or desires to supersede the interests of the Church. He contends that the individual cannot remain separated and expect to experience the “full benefit of the gospel”. He explains that while “even the best of men” must necessarily have countless differences and opinions, “we must not put them in opposition, nor on any pretense withdraw from our brethren”.<br><br>To conclude, Wesley exhorts his listeners to “cordially unite” in order to “sanctify” themselves, and to stand together against schismatic behavior. He maintains that, ultimately, schism is a self-imposed burden that, in addition to harming the individual and the church, carries serious spiritual consequences. He encourages his listeners to “firmly and cordially unite” in order to assure success in their spiritual journey.<br><br>John Wesley’s sermon, On Schism, serves as a reminder of the importance of upholding the unity of the church, and of avoiding schismatic behavior. He asserts that schism, or separation from other Christians, is a sin that harms both the individual and the entire body of Christ. Wesley exhorts his listeners to avoid such behavior and to “heartily agree in the same thing” in order to preserve the bonds of love that the church shares. He cautions against the consequences of schismatic behavior, and encourages individuals to engage in mutual edification and support in order to assure success in their spiritual journey. Ultimately, Wesley’s sermon serves as a timely reminder of the importance of avoiding disunity in our pursuit of the gospel.</p>
