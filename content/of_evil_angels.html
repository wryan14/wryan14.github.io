                    <p><br><br>John Wesley's sermon, Of Evil Angels, was delivered on February 18th, 1748 in the Foundery Chapel, London. The sermon seeks to explain what the bible indicates about evil angels, or demons, and how that relates to the living of life in a moral and faithful manner. <br><br>Wesley begins by affirming the Scriptural evidence of evil angels and separating it from non-biblical superstitions. He emphasizes that in the scriptures, evil angels appear as evil spirits, ranging from “ministering spirits” to “spiritual wickedness in high places.” These evil angels act as active agents, who tempt and hinder humans, especially in their attempt to live a truly Christian life. <br><br>He goes on to discuss two primary interfaces between evil angels and humans. The first is temptation, in which the evil angels are classified into two groups: those who “lay temptations in the heart”, and those that “attack the body”. Wesley then presents a second interface: hindering a human from following the will of God. He clarifies that this interface is different than that of temptation, noting that the devil particularly targets spiritual works, such as the preaching or prayer. <br><br>Wesley then provides advice for overcoming evil angels’ attempts to disrupt one’s faith and actions. He states that to “stop the devil’s mouth”, one must recognize that the victory over him comes from faith in the power and protection of Jesus. He encourages the hearers to have faith in Jesus, which is the only means to keep “Satan under our feet”. <br> <br>In conclusion, Wesley stresses the importance of vigilantly resisting evil influences, rejecting superstitions and religious fables, and trusting in the power of Jesus to provide protection against evil forces. He encourages the hearers to recognize that victory over evil comes through faith in Jesus, not in their own strength. For Wesley, vigilance over evil is one of the primary elements of living a moral and faithful life as a Christian. <br><br>John Wesley wrote this sermon to challenge his audience to recognize the danger that evil angels pose to their lives and how important it is to remain vigilant against them. He encourages faith in the power and protection of Jesus, rather than in the hearer’s own strength, arguing that this is the only way to “stop the devil’s mouth”. Wesley boldly argues that victory over evil comes through faith in Jesus, and a vigilant practice of rejecting superstition. Ultimately, he stresses the importance of living a moral and faithful life in order to remain sovereign over evil.</p>
