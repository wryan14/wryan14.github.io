John Wesley's sermon, On Communion, addresses the importance of partaking in the Lord's Supper. He emphasizes that communion isn't merely a ritual to be performed on certain occasions, but an important spiritual experience that should be taken advantage of. He urges people to avoid superficial consideration of the sacrament and implores them to focus instead on the spiritual implications and potential benefit of partaking in the Lord's Supper. Wesley also stresses that, even though the ceremony can be highly emotional and often filled with joy and thankfulness, it should still be taken seriously. He encourages people to pay attention to their thoughts and guard against any idle or sinful speculations during the ceremony. Finally, Wesley explains that, by partaking in communion, individuals become closer to one another and to God, and should, therefore, honor and revere the Lord's Supper.</p>
