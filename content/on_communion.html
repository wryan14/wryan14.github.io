                    <p><br><br>John Wesley’s sermon titled “On Communion” takes a theological approach in defining the purpose of the sacrament of Communion, including its symbolic and practical implications for Christians who partake in it. By carefully examining the biblical text and its orthodox interpretation, Wesley develops a trinitarian understanding of the “fellowship of the divine life” that results from taking Communion. This analysis of Wesley’s sermon will explore in detail how he draws on Scripture, history, and tradition in order to justify his position and how this understanding of Communion was a major part of the Methodist Gospel.<br><br>First, Wesley provides a biblical foundation for his argument in calling out certain scriptures, including John 6:56, 1 Corinthians 10:17 and 11:29, in order to demonstrate the importance of taking Communion. Wesley emphasizes that Christ commanded all those who beleived in him to participate in Communion, and that the purpose of Communion is to experience fellowship with God and his followers. He also focuses heavily on the incarnation of Christ and his presence in the bread and wine, arguing that those who partake in Communion actually partake in Christ himself, a process that can only be expressed in physical and tangible ways in order to be fully understood.<br><br>Furthermore, Wesley makes the case that Communion is deeply rooted in history, citing passages from ancient Christian Theologians such as Bede, Augustine of Hippo, and Cyprian of Carthage. He begins by connecting the story of the Last Supper, as found in the Gospels, with the notion that Communion unites the faithful with Christ, noting that this has been the predominant theological perspective since the early days of Christianity. By affirming the writings of influential ancient Theologians, Wesley gives creedence to his argument by connecting it to some of the oldest interpretations of Communion.<br><br>Finally, Wesley illuminates practical implications of taking Communion, noting that it is both a symbol and an embodiment of a bond shared between the faithful and God. In this way, Communion serves as a reminder of the divine life given to believers, who must strive for holiness and godliness to remain in fellowship with the divine. He also notes that Communion should be taken with reverence, steering away from the idea that it is simply a surface level ritual or act. <br><br>From this analysis, it is evident that Wesley’s sermon, “On Communion”, served as a critical building block for the greater Wesleyan revival movement. By carefully examining the biblical text, historically-rooted theological accounts, and practical implications of Communion, Wesley constructs a trinitarian definition of the “fellowship of the divine life” that serves as the foundation upon which the Methodist Gospel stands. This definition of Communion was, and still is, essential in upholding the spiritual value and importance of the practice of taking Communion in the Church.</p>
