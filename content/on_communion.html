The 1794 sermon, On Communion by John Wesley, outlines the importance of Christian communion and emphasizes the benefits of receiving communion in all aspects of one’s faith, particularly with regard to the mourning and rejoicing that communing brings. Wesley begins the sermon by stating the importance of the Sacrament of Communion, where the body and blood of Christ are taken in remembrance of his suffering and death. He urges readers not to view it as a mere obligation, but rather to see it as an opportunity to gain a spiritual benefit far greater than any mere mortal gift could ever give. The latter part of the sermon focuses on how these spiritual benefits work in practical ways, from bringing mourning and self-reflection, to joy and salvation.

Wesley highlights the ways in which communion can bring ‘mourning,’ which he believes should be a result of considering the death of Christ. He wishes for those receiving Communion to recognize and to deeply contemplate the severity of the sacrifice which Jesus has made for them. For Wesley, this contemplation is what brings true repentance, which is necessary for salvation. 

Moreover, Wesley highlights the many spiritual gifts which communing brings with it. As he puts it, “every act of fellowship with our Lord lays up a treasure in heaven”. People do not just take communion to remember Jesus’ death, but are blessed with countless other spiritual benefits. Wesley states that taken communion with humble hearts, there is always a great blessing associated with it as well. This can be salvation, repentance, joy, strength and peace.

At the end of On Communion, Wesley concludes by stating that all of these spiritual benefits are not just for those who are already followers of Jesus, but also for those who believe in him from a distance. As he puts it, “The farther off they are, they can no less worthily partake of it, though not of all its benefits”. This proves that Communion is not just a duty, but includes many spiritual and personal benefits. 

In conclusion, Wesley’s On Communion sermon is a powerful reminder of the power and beauty of Christian Communion and the many spiritual benefits it can bring to believers. From mourning and reflection to joy and salvation, Communion can bring comfort and hope to those who partake in it. Moreover, it is not reserved only for those who are devoted to Jesus, but those who believe from a distance can also receive some its blessings. Through his words, Wesley shows the importance of considering both the spiritual and physical implications of this Sacrament.</p>
