                    <p><br><br>John Wesley’s sermon, “Circumcision of the Heart,” outlines the sanctification of believers through a pastoral understanding of Old Testament spirituality. In the passage, Wesley leans on religious scriptures to discuss the two types of circumcision: physical and spiritual. <br><br>Drawing from the Old Testament books of Deuteronomy, Wesley explains the symbolism of physical circumcision and how it applies to believers today. He begins by asserting that through physical circumcision, the Hebrews recognized their position as the covenant people of God. This combination of physical and spiritual ritual was deemed necessary by God in order to keep His covenant with Israel and to mark the Hebrews as His chosen people. <br><br>In the New Testament, Wesley notes, the spiritual aspect of circumcision has replaced the physical. Believers are called to be circumcised in the heart, spiritually transformed through the power of the Holy Spirit and not through physical means. He posits that this inward circumcision is meant to signify a person’s willingness to sacrifice their irrelevant desires and adhere to the law of God. This spiritual metamorphosis is marked first by a realization and then repentance of personal sin. Ultimate change is only achieved through a sanctification process, when the believer commits themselves to living a life in accordance with God’s will. <br><br>Wesley continues to apply his sermon by discussing the practical implications of spiritual circumcision. He explains that through this process, believers are able to take action against their dominant desires and avoid committing acts of sin in their lives. This also involves continuously praying and meditating on God’s word, imploring the heavenly Father to help them change. To Wesley, true transformation is marked by obedience to the word of God, making His truth the primary rule in how one lives their life. Ultimately, Wesley states, this is the most effective way to honor God and demonstrate faith in His words through one’s actions and affections. <br><br>Through this sermon, John Wesley elucidates the importance of spiritual circumcision for believers in the New Testament, drawing heavily upon scriptures from Deuteronomy. He asserts that this spiritual transformation is marked by contrition, repentance, and obedience to the law of God, making these affections the dominant force in one’s life. He claims this should be done in order to effectively honor the covenant between God and His people, living out the truth of His word in both how one behaves and how one loves. By leaning on religious scriptures and providing both practical and spiritual applications, Wesley’s sermon offers a pastoral and meaningful understanding of transformation through Old Testament spirituality. </p>
