# Article Naming and Tagging Style Guide

## File Naming Conventions

### Structure
- **Format**: `kebab-case` (all lowercase, words separated by hyphens)
- **Extension**: Always `.md` for Markdown files
- **Length**: Keep concise but descriptive (2-4 words ideal)
- **No underscores**: Replace any underscores with hyphens

### Examples
✅ **Correct**:
- `grace-works-synthesis.md`
- `boehme-aurora-essay.md`
- `sermon-transcriber.md`

❌ **Incorrect**:
- `wolfslayer_surname.md` → Should be `wolfslayer-surname.md`
- `mind-forgd-manacles.md` → Consider `blake-digital-manacles.md` for clarity

### Special Cases
- **Historical figures**: Use last name first if focusing on their work: `boehme-aurora-essay.md`
- **Churches/buildings**: Use simplified names: `st-hippolytus-church.md` (not `saint-hippolytus-church.md`)
- **Technical documentation**: Include the tool/system name: `sermon-transcriber-docs.md`

## Article Title Conventions

### Format
- **Style**: Title Case (capitalize major words)
- **Length**: Descriptive but concise
- **Punctuation**: Use colons for subtitles, avoid special characters
- **No period at end** unless it's part of an abbreviation

### Structure Templates
1. **Analysis/Essay**: Keep simple, avoid subtitles unless essential
   - Example: "Jacob Boehme's Aurora and Theological Legacy"

2. **Historical**: Use minimal descriptors
   - Example: "St. Hippolytus Church in Helden"

3. **Contemporary/Digital**: Focus on core concept
   - Example: "Blake's Manacles in Digital Culture"

4. **Technical**: State what it is directly
   - Example: "Sermon Transcriber Documentation"

### Streamlining Principles
- **Avoid colons and subtitles** unless absolutely necessary
- **Remove redundant words** (e.g., "The" at the beginning)
- **Use "and" instead of colons** when connecting ideas
- **Keep under 8 words** when possible
- **Lead with the most recognizable element**

## Date Format
- **Standard**: `YYYY-MM-DD` (ISO 8601)
- **Example**: `2025-01-09`
- **Consistency**: Use the same format across all articles

## Tag Conventions

### General Rules
1. **Case**: All lowercase
2. **Separator**: Use spaces, not hyphens (except for multi-part proper nouns)
3. **Order**: Most specific to most general
4. **Limit**: 3-7 tags per article
5. **Consistency**: Use the same tag format across articles
6. **Create as needed**: These are examples – create new tags when your content requires them!

### Tag Categories and Examples

**Note**: The following are examples to illustrate formatting and organization. You should create new tags as needed for your specific content while following these formatting patterns.

**People** (use full name):
- `jacob boehme`
- `william blake`
- `[add new people as you write about them]`

**Fields/Disciplines**:
- `theology`
- `philosophy`
- `literature`
- `genealogy`
- `architecture`
- `[create new disciplines as needed]`

**Historical Periods/Movements**:
- `medieval germany`
- `german romanticism`
- `reformation`
- `[add periods relevant to your articles]`

**Specific Topics**:
- `mysticism`
- `dialectical theology`
- `participatory theology`
- `[develop new topic tags as your content expands]`

**Technology/Digital**:
- `digital culture`
- `social media`
- `automation`
- `ai tools`
- `[add emerging tech topics as relevant]`

**Geographic/Cultural**:
- `westphalia`
- `german history`
- `immigration`
- `[include new locations/cultures as you cover them]`

**Religious/Spiritual**:
- `catholic history`
- `church history`
- `biblical studies`
- `[expand with other traditions/topics as needed]`

**Architecture/Art**:
- `romanesque architecture`
- `sacred art`
- `[add artistic movements/styles you discuss]`

### Tag Hierarchy Examples
```
Specific → General
"jacob boehme" → "mysticism" → "theology"
"st hippolytus church" → "romanesque architecture" → "church history"
"sermon transcriber" → "openai" → "automation"
```

## Excerpt Guidelines

### Structure
- **Length**: 1-2 sentences (150-250 characters ideal)
- **Content**: Capture the core thesis or unique angle
- **Style**: Present tense, active voice when possible
- **No citations**: Keep clean and readable

### Examples
✅ **Good**:
> "Blake's 1794 concept of self-imposed mental chains finds striking parallels in today's digital dependencies and algorithmic echo chambers."

❌ **Avoid**:
> "This article examines how William Blake's concept from his poem 'London' (1794) might be applicable to understanding modern technology."

## Recommended Article Standardization

Based on these guidelines, here are the recommended changes:

1. **wolfslayer_surname.md** → `wolfslayer-surname.md`
2. **saint-hippolytus-church.md** → `st-hippolytus-church.md`
3. **mind-forgd-manacles.md** → `blake-digital-manacles.md` (optional, for clarity)

## Quick Reference Checklist

Before publishing an article, verify:

- [ ] File name uses kebab-case with no underscores
- [ ] Title follows appropriate template structure
- [ ] Date is in YYYY-MM-DD format
- [ ] Tags are lowercase and consistent with existing tags
- [ ] Excerpt captures the essence in 1-2 sentences
- [ ] All metadata fields are complete

## Implementation Notes

### For Existing Articles
When updating existing articles to match this guide:
1. Update file names (preserving redirects if needed)
2. Standardize tags across all articles
3. Keep a mapping of old → new names for reference

### For Future Articles
1. Check existing tags before creating new ones
2. Aim for tag reuse to build meaningful categories
3. Consider the article's primary audience when choosing between technical and accessible language

## Tag Master List (Examples to Build Upon)

**Important**: This is a starter list based on your current articles. You should actively expand this list with new tags as you write about new topics, people, places, and concepts. The goal is consistency in formatting, not limiting your tag vocabulary.

### People
- jacob boehme
- william blake
- **[Add new names as you write about them – economists, artists, theologians, etc.]**

### Core Disciplines
- theology
- philosophy
- literature
- history
- genealogy
- architecture
- technology
- **[Create tags for new fields – psychology, music, science, etc.]**

### Specific Topics
- mysticism
- digital culture
- social media
- biblical studies
- church history
- german history
- immigration
- automation
- **[Develop new topical tags freely – just maintain lowercase format]**

### Guidelines for Creating New Tags
When you write about something not yet in your tag list:
1. **Just create it!** Don't feel constrained by existing tags
2. **Follow the format**: lowercase, use spaces (not hyphens)
3. **Be specific**: "reformation theology" is better than just "religion"
4. **Think reusability**: Will you write about this topic again?
5. **Check similar articles**: Maintain consistency with related content

Example: If you write a new article about Carl Jung's influence on modern psychology, you might create:
- `carl jung` (new person tag)
- `analytical psychology` (new specific topic)
- `depth psychology` (new field/movement)

The tag system should grow organically with your content!
